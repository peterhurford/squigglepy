Numeric Distributions
=====================

A ``NumericDistribution`` represents a probability distribution as a histogram
of values along with the probability mass near each value.

A ``NumericDistribution`` is functionally equivalent to a Monte Carlo
simulation where you generate infinitely many samples and then group the
samples into finitely many bins, keeping track of the proportion of samples
in each bin (a.k.a. the probability mass) and the average value for each
bin.

Compared to a Monte Carlo simulation, ``NumericDistribution`` can represent
information much more densely by grouping together nearby values (although
some information is lost in the grouping). The benefit of this is most
obvious in fat-tailed distributions. In a Monte Carlo simulation, perhaps 1
in 1000 samples account for 10% of the expected value, but a
``NumericDistribution`` (with the right bin sizing method, see
:any:`BinSizing`) can easily track the probability mass of large values.

Accuracy
--------

The construction of ``NumericDistribution`` ensures that its expected value
is always close to 100% accurate. The higher moments (standard deviation,
skewness, etc.) and percentiles are less accurate, but still almost always
more accurate than Monte Carlo in practice.

We are probably most interested in the accuracy of percentiles. Consider a
simulation that applies binary operations to combine ``m`` different
``NumericDistribution`` s, each of which has ``n`` bins. The relative error of
estimated percentiles grows with approximately :math:`O(m / n^1.5)` or better.
That is, the error is proportional to the number of operations and inversely
proportional to the number of bins to the power of 1.5. This is only an
approximation, and the exact error rate depends on the shapes of the underlying
distributions.

Compare this to the relative error of percentiles for a Monte Carlo (MC)
simulation over a log-normal distribution. MC relative error grows with
:math:`O(1 / n)` [1], given the assumption that if our
``NumericDistribution`` has ``n`` bins, then our MC simulation runs ``n^2``
samples (because that way both have a runtime of approximately :math:`O(n^2)`).
So MC scales worse with ``n``, but better with ``m``.

I tested accuracy across a range of percentiles for a variety of values of ``m``
and ``n``. Although MC scales better with ``m`` than ``NumericDistribution``, MC
does not achieve lower error rates until ``m = 500`` or so when using 200
bins/40,000 MC samples (depending on the distribution shape). Few models will
use 500 distinct variables, so ``NumericDistribution`` should nearly always
perform better in practice.

We are also interested in the accuracy of the standard deviation. The error of
``NumericDistribution``'s estimated standard deviation scales with approximately
:math:`O(\sqrt[4]{m} / n^{1.5})`. The error of Monte Carlo standard deviation
scales with :math:`O(\sqrt{m} / n)`.

Where possible, ``NumericDistribution`` uses `Richardson extrapolation
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson_extrapolation>`_ over the bins to
improve accuracy. When done correctly, Richardson extrapolation significantly
reduces the big-O error of an operation. But doing Richardson extrapolation
correctly requires setting a rate parameter correctly, and the rate parameter
depends on the shape of the distribution and is not knowable in general.
``NumericDistribution`` simply uses the same rate parameter for all
distributions, which somewhat reduces error, but might not reduce the big-O
error.

Speed
-----
I tested ``NumericDistribution`` versus Monte Carlo on two fairly complex
example models (originally written by Laura Duffy to evaluate hypothetical
animal welfare and x-risk interventions). On the first model,
``NumericDistribution`` performed ~300x better at the same level of accuracy.
The second model used some operations for which I cannot reliably assess the
accuracy, but my best guess is that ``NumericDistribution`` performs ~10x
better.

``NumericDistribution`` may be
slower at the same level of accuracy for a model that uses sufficiently many
operations that ``NumericDistribution`` handles relatively poorly. The most
inaccurate operations are ``log`` and ``exp`` because they significantly alter
the shape of the distribution.

The biggest performance upside to Monte Carlo is that it is trivial to
parallelize by simply generating samples on separate threads.
``NumericDistribution`` does not currently support multithreading.

Some more details about the runtime performance of ``NumericDistribution``:

Where ``n`` is the number of bins, constructing a ``NumericDistribution`` or
performing a unary operation has runtime :math:`O(n)`. A binary operation (such
as addition or multiplication) has a runtime close to :math:`O(n^2)`. To be
precise, the runtime is :math:`O(n^2 \log(n))` because the :math:`n^2` results
of a binary operation must be partitioned into :math:`n` ordered bins. In
practice, this partitioning operation takes up a fairly small portion of the
runtime for ``n = 200`` (which is the default bin count), and takes up ~half the
runtime for ``n = 1000``.

For ``n = 200``, a binary operation takes about twice as long as constructing a
``NumericDistribution``. Even though construction is :math:`O(n)` and binary
operations are :math:`O(n^2)`, construction has a much worse constant factor for
normal and log-normal distributions because construction requires repeatedly
computing the `error function <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_function>`_,
which is fairly slow.

The accuracy to speed ratio gets worse as ``n`` increases, so you typically
don't want to use bin counts larger than the default unless you're particularly
concerned about accuracy.

Implementation Details
======================

On setting values within bins
-----------------------------
Whenever possible, NumericDistribution assigns the value of each bin as the
average value between the two edges (weighted by mass). You can think of
this as the result you'd get if you generated infinitely many Monte Carlo
samples and grouped them into bins, setting the value of each bin as the
average of the samples. You might call this the expected value (EV) method,
in contrast to two methods described below.

The EV method guarantees that, whenever the histogram width covers the full
support of the distribution, the histogram's expected value exactly equals
the expected value of the true distribution (modulo floating point rounding
errors).

There are some other methods we could use, which are generally worse:

1. Set the value of each bin to the average of the two edges (the
"trapezoid rule"). The purpose of using the trapezoid rule is that we don't
know the probability mass within a bin (perhaps the CDF is too hard to
evaluate) so we have to estimate it. But whenever we *do* know the CDF, we
can calculate the probability mass exactly, so we don't need to use the
trapezoid rule.

2. Set the value of each bin to the center of the probability mass (the
"mass method"). This is equivalent to generating infinitely many Monte
Carlo samples and grouping them into bins, setting the value of each bin as
the **median** of the samples. This approach does not particularly help us
because we don't care about the median of every bin. We might care about
the median of the distribution, but we can calculate that near-exactly
regardless of what value-setting method we use by looking at the value in
the bin where the probability mass crosses 0.5. And the mass method will
systematically underestimate (the absolute value of) EV because the
definition of expected value places larger weight on larger (absolute)
values, and the mass method does not.

Although the EV method perfectly measures the expected value of a distribution,
it systematically underestimates the variance. To see this, consider that it is
possible to define the variance of a random variable X as :math:`E[X^2] -
E[X]^2`. The EV method correctly estimates :math:`E[X]`, so it also correctly
estimates :math:`E[X]^2`. However, it systematically underestimates
:math:`E[X^2]` because :math:`E[X^2]` places more weight on larger values. But
an alternative method that accurately estimated variance would necessarily
overestimate :math:`E[X]`. It's possible to force both mean and variance to be
exactly correct by adjusting the value of each bin according to its z-score, but
this could make other summary statistics less accurate.

On bin sizing for two-sided distributions
-----------------------------------------
:any:`squigglepy.numeric_distribution.BinSizing` describes the various
bin-sizing methods and their properties. ``BinSizing.ev`` is usually preferred.
``BinSizing.ev`` allocates bins such that each bin contributes equally to the
distribution's expected value. This has the nice property that bins are narrower
in the regions that matter more for the distribution's EV, for example, in
fat-tailed distributions it more bins in the tail(s) and fewer bins in the
center.

The interpretation of the EV bin-sizing method is slightly non-obvious
for two-sided distributions because we must decide how to interpret bins
with negative expected value.

The EV method arranges values into bins such that:
    * The negative side has the correct negative contribution to EV and the
      positive side has the correct positive contribution to EV.
    * Every negative bin has equal contribution to EV and every positive bin
      has equal contribution to EV.
    * If a side has nonzero probability mass, then it has at least one bin,
      regardless of how small its mass.
    * The number of negative and positive bins are chosen such that the
      absolute contribution to EV for negative bins is as close as possible
      to the absolute contribution to EV for positive bins given the above
      constraints.

This binning method means that the distribution EV is exactly preserved
and there is no bin that contains the value zero. However, the positive
and negative bins do not necessarily have equal contribution to EV, and
the magnitude of the error is at most ``1 / num_bins / 2``.
