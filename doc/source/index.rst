Squigglepy: Implementation of Squiggle in Python
================================================

`Squiggle <https://www.squiggle-language.com/>`__ is a "simple
programming language for intuitive probabilistic estimation". It serves
as its own standalone programming language with its own syntax, but it
is implemented in JavaScript. I like the features of Squiggle and intend
to use it frequently, but I also sometimes want to use similar
functionalities in Python, especially alongside other Python statistical
programming packages like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The
**squigglepy** package here implements many Squiggle-like
functionalities in Python.
